# ELO Ranking System Analysis

## Current Implementation Overview

The HotOrNot plugin implements an ELO-inspired rating system for ranking performers and images in Stash. The system supports three comparison modes:

1. **Swiss Mode** (⚖️) - Fair matchups between similarly-rated items where both ratings adjust
2. **Gauntlet Mode** (🎯) - Single item climbs from bottom until defeated
3. **Champion Mode** (🏆) - Winner stays on to battle new challengers

## Current ELO Formula Analysis

### Location
File: `/plugins/hotornot/hotornot.js`
Function: `handleComparison()` (lines 579-631)

### Current Implementation Details

#### 1. Expected Score Formula
```javascript
const expectedWinner = 1 / (1 + Math.pow(10, ratingDiff / 40));
```

**Analysis:**
- Uses rating difference divided by 40
- Standard ELO typically uses 400 as the divisor
- **Current divisor of 40** means a 40-point difference = ~76% expected win probability
- **Standard divisor of 400** would mean a 400-point difference = ~91% expected win probability
- With a 1-100 scale (vs traditional 1000-3000), the divisor of 40 is actually **appropriate**

**Mathematical Relationship:**
- Traditional ELO: `E = 1 / (1 + 10^((Rb - Ra) / 400))`
- Current HotOrNot: `E = 1 / (1 + 10^((Rb - Ra) / 40))`
- Since the rating scale is ~10x smaller (100 vs 1000-2000), the divisor is correctly scaled ~10x smaller (40 vs 400)

#### 2. K-Factor
```javascript
// Dynamic K-factor based on match count (reduced from USCF/FIDE approach)
// New performers (0-9 matches): K = 16 (reduced from 32)
// Moderately established (10-29 matches): K = 12 (reduced from 24)
// Well-established (30+ matches): K = 8 (reduced from 16)
```

**Analysis:**
- Dynamic K-factor varies based on match count for accurate rating adjustments
- Uses a reduced version of the USCF/FIDE approach to slow rating changes
- Makes it harder for performers to jump quickly to extreme ratings

**Standard ELO K-Factor Ranges:**
- FIDE (Chess): 40 for new players, 20 for experienced, 10 for masters
- Online games: Often 32-64 for new, 16-32 for experienced
- HotOrNot uses: 16 for new, 12 for moderate, 8 for established (reduced to slow rating changes)

**Scene Count Weighting (Performers):**
Performers with more scenes have more stable ratings (lower K-factor):
- 100+ scenes: 50% K-factor (very stable)
- 50-99 scenes: 65% K-factor
- 20-49 scenes: 80% K-factor
- 10-19 scenes: 90% K-factor
- <10 scenes: Full K-factor (no reduction)

This reflects that performers with extensive filmography have more "evidence" of their quality and their rating should be more stable.

**Implications:**
- Dynamic K-factor on 1-100 scale means:
  - New performers converge at a moderate pace (max ±16 points)
  - Established ratings remain more stable (max ±8 points)
  - Prolific performers (100+ scenes) have very stable ratings (max ±4 points)
  - Better balance between responsiveness and stability

**Diminishing Returns at Higher Ratings:**
A new feature applies diminishing returns to rating gains as performers approach 100 using the formula `(distance_from_100 / 50)^2`:
- At rating 50: 100% of calculated gain (multiplier = 1.0)
- At rating 75: 25% of calculated gain (multiplier = 0.25)
- At rating 90: 4% of calculated gain (multiplier = 0.04)
- At rating 95: 1% of calculated gain (multiplier = 0.01)
- Minimum gain of 1 point is always ensured for ratings below 100

This makes reaching 100 progressively harder, requiring many more wins at higher ratings.

#### 3. Rating Change Calculation

**Swiss Mode (both players adjust):**
```javascript
winnerGain = Math.max(1, Math.round(kFactor * (1 - expectedWinner)));
loserLoss = Math.max(1, Math.round(kFactor * expectedWinner));
```

**Gauntlet/Champion Mode (only active player adjusts):**
- Only the champion/falling item's rating changes
- Defenders stay the same (used as benchmarks)
- Exception: Rank #1 defender receives full ELO penalty when defeated (not just -1)

**Issues Identified:**
- `Math.max(1, ...)` forces minimum change of 1 point even when ELO formula suggests 0
- This can cause **rating inflation** over time
- Violates zero-sum principle in Swiss mode

#### 4. Rating Bounds
```javascript
let newWinnerRating = Math.min(100, Math.max(1, winnerRating + winnerGain));
let newLoserRating = Math.min(100, Math.max(1, loserRating - loserLoss));

// Ensure winner ranks higher than loser after a direct win
if (newWinnerRating < newLoserRating) {
  if (newLoserRating === 100) {
    // Loser is at ceiling, reduce to make room for winner
    newLoserRating = 99;
    newWinnerRating = 100;
  } else {
    newWinnerRating = newLoserRating + 1;
  }
}
```

- Ratings clamped to 1-100 range
- Standard approach for bounded rating systems
- **Winner Rank Guarantee**: After a direct head-to-head win, the winner is guaranteed to rank higher than the loser. If the ELO calculation alone doesn't achieve this, the winner's rating is adjusted to be 1 point above the loser's new rating. At the rating ceiling (100), the loser is reduced to 99 to ensure the winner can reach 100.

## Identified Issues and Recommendations

### Issue 1: Non-Zero-Sum Rating Changes (CRITICAL)

**Problem:**
```javascript
winnerGain = Math.max(1, Math.round(kFactor * (1 - expectedWinner)));
loserLoss = Math.max(1, Math.round(kFactor * expectedWinner));
```

When both values are forced to minimum 1:
- If expectedWinner = 0.99 (strong favorite wins):
  - Formula: winnerGain = 0.08, loserLoss = 7.92
  - Actual: winnerGain = 1, loserLoss = 8
  - **Net change: -7 points (deflation)**

- If expectedWinner = 0.01 (huge upset):
  - Formula: winnerGain = 7.92, loserLoss = 0.08
  - Actual: winnerGain = 8, loserLoss = 1
  - **Net change: +7 points (inflation)**

**Impact:**
- In Swiss mode, this violates the zero-sum principle
- Can cause systematic rating drift over many comparisons
- More upsets = inflation, more expected results = deflation

**Recommendation:**
Option A (Proper Zero-Sum):
```javascript
const expectedChange = kFactor * (1 - expectedWinner);
const roundedChange = Math.round(expectedChange);
winnerGain = Math.max(0, roundedChange);  // Allow 0
loserLoss = Math.max(0, roundedChange);   // Allow 0
```

Option B (Symmetric Minimum):
```javascript
const expectedChange = kFactor * (1 - expectedWinner);
const roundedChange = Math.max(1, Math.round(expectedChange));
winnerGain = roundedChange;
loserLoss = roundedChange;  // Same value for zero-sum
```

**Recommended: Option A** - Allows no change for extremely expected results, maintaining zero-sum property.

### Issue 2: Fixed K-Factor for All Items

**Problem:**
- New items with 0 comparisons use same K-factor as items with 100+ comparisons
- Ratings stabilize too slowly for new items
- Established ratings change too much from single comparisons

**Recommendation:**
Implement dynamic K-factor based on comparison count:

```javascript
function getKFactor(itemId, currentRating) {
  const comparisonCount = getComparisonCount(itemId); // Need to track this
  
  if (comparisonCount < 10) {
    return 16;  // High volatility for new items (2x current)
  } else if (comparisonCount < 30) {
    return 12;  // Medium volatility
  } else {
    return 8;   // Low volatility for established ratings
  }
}
```

**Alternative (simpler, no tracking needed):**
Rating-based K-factor:
```javascript
function getKFactor(currentRating) {
  // Items near extremes are likely more established
  const distanceFromMiddle = Math.abs(currentRating - 50);
  
  if (distanceFromMiddle < 10) {
    return 12;  // Unproven items near default rating
  } else {
    return 8;   // Established items with clear ratings
  }
}
```

### Issue 3: Rating Window for Swiss Mode Matchmaking

**Current:**
```javascript
// Find items within ±15 rating points
return Math.abs(rating - rating1) <= 15;
```

**Analysis:**
- ±15 points on 1-100 scale = ±30% of total range
- On traditional 1000-2000 scale, equivalent to ±300 points
- This is quite wide for "similar" ratings

**Recommendation:**
Make the window adaptive based on pool size:
```javascript
function getSimilarityWindow(totalItems, currentRating) {
  // Tighter window for larger pools
  if (totalItems > 50) {
    return 10;  // ±10 points
  } else if (totalItems > 20) {
    return 15;  // ±15 points (current)
  } else {
    return 25;  // ±25 points for small pools
  }
}
```

### Issue 4: Initial Rating Distribution

**Current:**
```javascript
const rating1 = scene1.rating100 || 50;
```

**Problem:**
- All new items start at 50
- Creates initial clustering at midpoint
- Can take many comparisons to spread out

**Recommendation:**
Option A: Keep 50 (simplest, most standard)
Option B: Add small random variance:
```javascript
const defaultRating = item.rating100 || (50 + Math.floor(Math.random() * 10 - 5)); // 45-55
```

**Recommended: Keep Option A (50)** - Random variance could confuse users and isn't standard ELO practice.

### Issue 5: Gauntlet Mode Rating Changes

**Current Behavior:**
- Only active (champion/falling) item changes rating
- Defenders are static benchmarks
- Rank #1 item loses 1 point when defeated

**Analysis:**
- This isn't traditional ELO (not zero-sum)
- Makes sense for the game mode (faster, more exciting)
- Could cause rating drift if same items are defenders repeatedly

**Recommendation:**
Keep current behavior but document it clearly as non-ELO. Consider optional "True ELO" gauntlet mode where both change.

### Issue 6: No Rating Decay or Recency Weighting

**Current:**
- Ratings never decay
- Old comparisons weighted same as recent ones

**Consideration:**
For content that changes over time (e.g., performers' appearance), might want:
- Time decay: Reduce ratings toward mean over time
- Recency weighting: Recent comparisons matter more

**Recommendation:**
Not needed for current use case. Items (performers/images) don't inherently change. Can add later if requested.

## Proposed Changes

### Change 1: Fix Zero-Sum Rating Calculation
**File:** `hotornot.js`, line 616-617
**Current:**
```javascript
winnerGain = Math.max(1, Math.round(kFactor * (1 - expectedWinner)));
loserLoss = Math.max(1, Math.round(kFactor * expectedWinner));
```

**Proposed:**
```javascript
winnerGain = Math.max(0, Math.round(kFactor * (1 - expectedWinner)));
loserLoss = Math.max(0, Math.round(kFactor * expectedWinner));
```

### Change 2: Implement Dynamic K-Factor
**File:** `hotornot.js`, before line 579
**Add new function:**
```javascript
function getKFactor(currentRating) {
  // Items near the default rating (50) are likely less established
  // Items far from 50 have likely had more comparisons
  const distanceFromDefault = Math.abs(currentRating - 50);
  
  if (distanceFromDefault < 10) {
    return 12;  // Higher K for unproven items near default
  } else if (distanceFromDefault < 25) {
    return 10;  // Medium K for moderately established items
  } else {
    return 8;   // Lower K for well-established items
  }
}
```

**Update usage (line 597, 614):**
```javascript
// Gauntlet/Champion mode
const kFactor = getKFactor(winnerRating);

// Swiss mode
const kFactor = getKFactor(winnerRating);
```

### Change 3: Adaptive Swiss Matching Window
**File:** `hotornot.js`, line 757-762
**Current:**
```javascript
const similarPerformers = performers.filter(s => {
  if (s.id === performer1.id) return false;
  const rating = s.rating100 || 50;
  return Math.abs(rating - rating1) <= 15;
});
```

**Proposed:**
```javascript
const matchWindow = performers.length > 50 ? 10 : performers.length > 20 ? 15 : 25;
const similarPerformers = performers.filter(s => {
  if (s.id === performer1.id) return false;
  const rating = s.rating100 || 50;
  return Math.abs(rating - rating1) <= matchWindow;
});
```

## Testing Recommendations

After implementing changes:

1. **Unit Tests** (if test framework exists):
   - Test zero-sum property: `winnerGain + loserChange should equal 0`
   - Test K-factor ranges with various ratings
   - Test boundary conditions (1, 50, 100 ratings)

2. **Manual Testing**:
   - Create test database with known ratings
   - Perform series of comparisons
   - Verify average rating remains stable (no inflation/deflation)
   - Check that new items reach accurate rating faster

3. **Statistical Analysis** (optional):
   - Track rating distribution over time
   - Monitor average rating (should stay near 50)
   - Check rating spread (standard deviation)

## Mathematical Verification

### Zero-Sum Check
For Swiss mode, rating changes should sum to zero:
```
ΔR_winner + ΔR_loser = 0
winnerGain + (-loserLoss) = 0
winnerGain = loserLoss
```

Current code can violate this. Proposed fix ensures:
```javascript
const change = Math.max(0, Math.round(kFactor * (1 - expectedWinner)));
winnerGain = change;
loserLoss = change;
// Therefore: change + (-change) = 0 ✓
```

### K-Factor Impact Analysis

With current K=8 on 1-100 scale:
- 50 vs 50: Expected 0.5, gain = 4 points
- 70 vs 50: Expected 0.76, gain = 2 points (favorite), 6 points (underdog)
- 90 vs 50: Expected 0.91, gain = 1 point (favorite), 7 points (underdog)

With proposed dynamic K (12 for new, 8 for established):
- New vs New (50 vs 50): gain = 6 points (50% faster convergence)
- Established (70) vs New (50): 
  - New wins: +9 points
  - Established wins: +3 points
- More responsive to early results while protecting established ratings

## Conclusion

The current implementation is a reasonable ELO-inspired system, but has some mathematical issues that could cause rating drift over time. The recommended changes are:

1. **Must Fix**: Zero-sum property in Swiss mode
2. **Should Add**: Dynamic K-factor for faster convergence
3. **Nice to Have**: Adaptive matching window

These changes maintain the spirit of the current system while making it more mathematically sound and responsive to new items.

## Algorithm Comparison: Is HotOrNot Using the Best Approach?

### Available Ranking Algorithms for Head-to-Head Battles

| Algorithm     | Best For                       | Handles Uncertainty | Complexity | Recommended For |
|---------------|--------------------------------|---------------------|------------|-----------------|
| **Elo**       | Simple 1v1, chess-like matches | No                  | Low        | HotOrNot ✓      |
| **Glicko-2**  | Online games, uneven activity  | Yes                 | Medium     | More advanced   |
| **TrueSkill** | Team/multiplayer games         | Yes                 | High       | Xbox Live       |
| **Bradley-Terry** | Statistical research       | No                  | Low-Med    | Academic use    |

### Current HotOrNot Implementation Assessment

**What HotOrNot Does Well:**

1. **Adaptive K-Factor Based on Match Count** ✅
   - New performers (<10 matches): K=16 (faster convergence)
   - Established (10-29 matches): K=12
   - Well-established (30+ matches): K=8
   - This follows FIDE/USCF best practices for chess ratings

2. **Scene Count as Additional Weighting Factor** ✅ (INNOVATIVE)
   - 100+ scenes: 50% K-factor multiplier (very stable ratings)
   - 50-99 scenes: 65% K-factor
   - 20-49 scenes: 80% K-factor
   - This is a **novel and smart approach** - performers with more "evidence" (scenes) have more stable ratings
   - Similar logic is used in Glicko-2 where more games = higher confidence

3. **Scaled Divisor for 1-100 Range** ✅
   - Uses divisor of 40 instead of standard 400
   - Correctly scaled for the 1-100 rating range (vs traditional 1000-2800)

4. **Winner Rank Guarantee** ✅
   - Ensures winner always ranks above loser after direct victory
   - Prevents ELO anomalies where winner could end up with lower rating

5. **Diminishing Returns at High Ratings** ✅ (INNOVATIVE)
   - Makes reaching 100 progressively harder
   - Prevents rating ceiling clustering

6. **Multiple Battle Modes** ✅
   - Swiss (fair matchups)
   - Gauntlet (placement mode)
   - Champion (king of the hill)

**Areas for Potential Improvement:**

1. **Rating Deviation/Uncertainty** (Glicko-2 Feature)
   - Could track a "confidence" metric that increases with more matches
   - Would allow showing how certain the rating is

2. **Time-Based Decay** (Optional)
   - Could reduce confidence for performers not compared recently
   - Not critical for static content like performers

### Expert Assessment: Is This the Best Factoring?

**Short Answer: Yes, for your use case.**

The HotOrNot implementation is **well-designed** for a performer ranking system:

1. **Elo is appropriate** - You have simple 1v1 comparisons, not team battles
2. **Scene count weighting is clever** - Acts as a proxy for "rating confidence" without full Glicko-2 complexity
3. **Match count K-factor is standard practice** - Follows chess federation guidelines
4. **Diminishing returns is innovative** - Prevents inflation at the top

**The scene count weighting is particularly well-designed because:**
- It recognizes that performers with 100+ scenes have more "evidence" supporting their ranking
- It's computationally simpler than implementing full Glicko-2 RD (Rating Deviation)
- It provides similar benefits to Glicko's uncertainty model

**Would Glicko-2 be better?** Marginally, but the added complexity isn't worth it for this use case. Your scene count weighting achieves similar benefits with a simpler implementation.

### Recommendations

1. **Keep Current Algorithm** - ELO with adaptive K-factor is appropriate
2. **Scene Count Weighting is Good** - Continue using it as a stabilizing factor
3. **Consider Adding** (optional):
   - Display confidence level based on match count (e.g., "Rating: 75 (±5)")
   - Track last comparison date for potential future decay

**Overall Grade: A-** 
The implementation follows best practices and adds innovative features like scene count weighting. The only minor improvement would be implementing proper zero-sum in Swiss mode (already documented in recommendations above).
